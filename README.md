# MyAngularApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.0.

## Project Structure

This repository contains both the **frontend** (Angular app) and the **backend** (Node.js/Express or similar) directories.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🖥️ Frontend (Angular)

#### Development server

To start the Angular development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, use:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

#### Building the frontend

To build the Angular project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

#### Running unit tests

```bash
ng test
```

#### Running end-to-end tests

```bash
ng e2e
```

> Note: Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

### 🛠️ Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Make sure your backend is running on a separate port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`) and configure CORS properly if needed.
